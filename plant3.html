  <p>These are the dead leaves of a Texas Live Oak Tree (Quercus fusiformis). They can commonly be found in Austin Texas! This one possibly hung out with the wrong kind of Austinites... this tree seems to have abused some drugs here and there and they aged horribly. Their biggest secret is that they are a moderator on r/Drugs... Do better Live Oak...</p>
