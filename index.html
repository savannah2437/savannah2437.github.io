This shrub is drought tolerant and can grow up to 10ish feet tall. Since it cant grow as tall as the trees, sadly the Firebush stays out of the drama. It spends at least 8 hours a day on r/OutOftheLoop because its gota stay in the loop somehow.

They pop out pretty much one time a year. This is mainly because they spend all year scrolling on r/MaleFashionAdvice and they get the stregth to show out only once a year. </span>

It thrives in hot humid climates which makes it a great fit for Texas. This plant knows shes a baddie and she just wants to spread love. When she does get on the dating scene shes always submitting questions on r/Dating because she wants to make sure shes doing this whole love thing right. Her biggest fear is breaking someones heart.

          <span class="label">This plant is called Longhair Plume Grass aka Dichelache crinita. It can grow up to 1.5 meters high. This fella is a little odd because there was only one of him there, not a bunch. He seems to be on his own path of life, not following the rules. Rumor has it he doesnt want a real job, he just lets life flow through him. His family argues he needs to get off r/antiWork but he claims his lifestyle is a political statement (he needs to move out).  </span>

It grows about 4 ft tall in 10 years. Because of the "late blooming" the yucca is a bit off socially but everyone still loves him- if anything its his charm. He tries to study methods on r/SocialSkills but its ok yucca, just be yourself. </span>

It thrives in the sun and can tolderate both acidic and alkaline conditions. However when it comes to politics, they have zero tolerence for their opposing views. They stay to their morals and want justice for all. But sometimes they can get a little too wrapped up in r/Politics. Their favorite hobby is getting in a political argument online. </span>

They are like magnets to bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. Sometimes all the attention from those pollinators freaks them out a little. Her friend says its natural but she cant help but be a little weirded out. She scrolls on r/AmIOverReacting for reassurance everyday which helps her feel better. #Celeb.
