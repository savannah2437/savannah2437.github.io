  <h1>Moss Ball</h1>
  <img src="explainlikeimfive.jpg" alt="Plant 1" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;">
  <p>This moss ball (Tillandsia recurvata) is commonly found in the Southern US. These little moss balls are always seen in groups because that really the only way they can work. A lot of them want to be independant but they cant figure it out. Thats why you might often see them on r/ExplainLikeImFive</p>
